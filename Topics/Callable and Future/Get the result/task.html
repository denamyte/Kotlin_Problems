<p>Suppose that you want to count the number of occurrences of a word in a large file. Since the operation can take a very long time, you decide to do it asynchronously in order to prevent blocking the <code class="language-kotlin">main</code> thread of the application.</p>
<p>You have the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
val countWordInFile = Callable {
    var wordsCount = 0
    // accessing a file and calculating wordsCount
    wordsCount
}
val task = executor.submit(countWordInFile)

// some other statements here
TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(15)

val count = task.get()</code></pre>
<p>What may happen after invoking the <code class="language-kotlin">get</code> method of <code class="language-kotlin">task</code> (the last line)?</p>
<p>Select all possible cases.</p>
