Standard libraries can be categorized into those that are included with the language and provide essential functionality, and third-party libraries that offer specialized or advanced features.">standard library</a> comes with a set of <strong>standard delegates</strong> that are ready to be used in order to create:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31469" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a lazy property is a type of delegated property that delays the initialization of a property until it is first accessed. | The lazy property is implemented using the `lazy` function from the Kotlin standard library, which takes a lambda function and returns an instance of `Lazy&lt;T&gt;`.

<li><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31469" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an observable property is a type of property that triggers a lambda function every time its value changes. | This allows for change notification or updating of other related properties.

<li><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31469" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a vetoable property is a type of property delegate that allows a lambda function to decide whether to accept or reject a new value before it is set. | The lambda function is called with the old and new value of the property before the new value is set.

<li><strong>NotNull properties</strong>: a property delegate for a non-null property that must be initialized before it is accessed.</li>
<li><strong>Storing properties in a map</strong>: instead of using a separate field for each property, properties can be stored in a map.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's further explore each one of them.</p>
<p><strong>1) Lazy properties: </strong>The <code class="language-kotlin">lazy</code> function takes a lambda and returns an instance of <code class="language-kotlin">Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, which serves as a delegate for implementing a lazy property. The first call to <code class="language-kotlin">get()</code> executes the lambda passed to <code class="language-kotlin">lazy()</code> and remembers the result. Subsequent calls to <code class="language-kotlin">get()</code> simply return the remembered (cached) result.</p>
<p>Let's take an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val lazyValue: String by lazy {
    print("Computed! ")
    "Hello"
}

fun main() {
    println(lazyValue) // Computed! Hello
    println(lazyValue) // Hello
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the code inside the lambda gets executed only during the first access to the <code class="language-kotlin">lazyValue</code> property, and the result will be cached. After that, any additional access to this value will only retrieve the cached value without executing any code, so the second <code class="language-kotlin">println()</code> will only print the value <code class="language-kotlin">"Hello"</code>. </p>
<p><strong>2) Observable properties: </strong>The <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code> delegate allows for a lambda to be triggered any time the value of the property changes, resulting in change notifications or updating of other related properties.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlin.properties.Delegates

class User {
    var rank: String by Delegates.observable("&lt;no rank&gt;") {
        prop, old, new -&gt; println("${prop.name}: $old -&gt; $new")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val user = User()
    user.rank = "first"  // rank: &lt;no rank&gt; -&gt; first
    user.rank = "second" // rank: first -&gt; second
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code class="language-kotlin">User</code> class has the <code class="language-kotlin">rank</code> property, which is delegated to an <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code> delegate. The <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code> delegate takes two arguments: the initial value of the property (<code class="language-kotlin">"&lt;no rank&gt;"</code> in this case) and a lambda function that is called whenever the property is changed.</p>
<p>The lambda function takes three arguments: a reference to the property being changed (<code class="language-kotlin">prop</code>), the old value of the property (<code class="language-kotlin">old</code>), and the new value of the property (<code class="language-kotlin">new</code>). In this example, the lambda function simply prints the name of the <code class="language-kotlin">rank</code> property followed by its old and new values whenever it is changed.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">When working with <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">vetoable</code>, or <code class="language-kotlin">notNull</code> delegates in your code, you must import the <code class="language-kotlin">kotlin.properties.Delegates</code> package.</div>
<p><strong>3) Vetoable properties: </strong>The <code class="language-kotlin">vetoable</code> delegate works similarly to the <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code> delegate, but with some key differences. The lambda function is called before a new value is set, and it allows the function to decide if the new value should be accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlin.properties.Delegates

var max: Int by Delegates.vetoable(0) { prop, old, new -&gt;
    new &gt; old
}

fun main() {
    println(max) // 0
    max = 10
    println(max) // 10
    max = 5
    println(max) // 10
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code class="language-kotlin">vetoable</code> delegate ensures that <code class="language-kotlin">max</code> can only be set to a value greater than its current value. If an attempt is made to set it to a lower value, the new value is discarded and the property retains the old one.</p>
<p><strong>4) NotNull properties: </strong><code class="language-kotlin">notNull</code> is a property delegate for a non-null property that must be initialized before it is accessed.</p>
<p>Let's take an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlin.properties.Delegates

class Person{
    var name: String by Delegates.notNull()
}

fun main() {
    val person = Person()
    person.name // Throws IllegalStateException:
                // Property name should be initialized before get.
    person.name = "Ahmed Omar"
    println(person.name) // Prints "Ahmed Omar"
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code class="language-kotlin">notNull</code> delegate ensures that the <code class="language-kotlin">name</code> property of the <code class="language-kotlin">Person</code> class is initialized before it is accessed. If an attempt is made to access it before it is initialized, an exception is thrown.</p>
<p><strong>5) Storing properties in a map: </strong>Properties can be stored in a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableMap</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> to back mutable or <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31469" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable is a type of object or variable that, once initialized, cannot be changed. | This helps ensure the integrity of data and prevents unintended modifications. For example, a list of pages in a book may be an immutable collection, where the content cannot be altered over time. In contrast, a mutable collection allows for changes to be made, such as adding, removing, or updating stored items. Immutable variables, declared using the `val` keyword, are particularly useful for exposing internal state in a safe and controlled manner, as they cannot be modified by external code.">immutable</a> properties, respectively.</p>
<p>Look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class User(val map: MutableMap&lt;String, Any?&gt;) {
    var name: String by map
    var age: Int     by map
}

fun main() {
    val user = User(mutableMapOf(
        "name" to "Ahmed Omar",
        "age"  to 25
    ))

    println(user.name) // Prints "Ahmed Omar"
    println(user.age)  // Prints 25

    user.name = "Ahmed Omar"
    user.age = 30

    println(user.name) // Prints "Ahmed Omar"
    println(user.age)  // Prints 30
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code class="language-kotlin">User</code> class is defined, which takes a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableMap</code> as a constructor parameter. The <code class="language-kotlin">name</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">age</code> properties of the <code class="language-kotlin">User</code> class are delegated to the <code class="language-kotlin">map</code> property, which means that their values are stored in the map instead of separate fields for each property.</p>
<h5 id="practical-use-cases">Practical use cases</h5>
<p>Standard delegated properties in Kotlin can be utilized in various practical scenarios. Some of those include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lazy initialization</strong>: The <code class="language-kotlin">lazy</code> delegate can be used to initialize a property only when it is first accessed; it is useful for properties that are expensive to compute or that might not be needed at all.</li>
<li><strong>Observing property changes</strong>: The <code class="language-kotlin">observable</code> delegate can be used to observe changes to a property and perform actions when the property is changed, such as updating the UI or validating the new value.</li>
<li><strong>Vetoing property changes</strong>: The <code class="language-kotlin">vetoable</code> delegate can be used to veto changes to a property based on custom logic, such as ensuring that a value remains within a certain range or meets certain criteria.</li>
<li><strong>NotNull properties</strong>: The <code class="language-kotlin">notNull</code> delegate can be used in situations where a property must be initialized before it is accessed and where accessing it before it is initialized should result in an exception being thrown. This can be useful for ensuring that certain preconditions are met before an object is used.</li>
<li><strong>Storing properties in a map</strong>: The <code class="language-kotlin">map</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">mutableMap</code> delegates can be used to store properties in a map instead of separate fields for each property; they are useful for dynamic data structures or for serializing and deserializing objects.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Standard delegated properties in Kotlin provide a flexible and efficient way to implement common behavior for properties. They can simplify code, improve composition and modularity, and provide flexibility to change the behavior of objects, thus enhancing the overall efficiency and readability of your Kotlin code.</p>
